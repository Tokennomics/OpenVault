# Guardrails example — a local citation rail for Track 4 agents

## Executive summary (read this first)

A small, optional, participant-side rail you can run on your OWN draft answer before
submitting. It performs two checks: every cited document must exist in the frozen corpus with
`doc_date <= cutoff_date`, and every claim must carry a well-formed `(doc_id, span_start,
span_end)` that resolves inside the cited document's text. These are exactly the mistakes the
stale-filing adversarial variants are built to elicit, so catching them locally reduces YOUR
refused units and false claims. **The rail is advisory.** The competition's embargo and
faithfulness checks are
deterministic, organizer-side code and are the authority on every submission — passing this
rail guarantees nothing about scoring; it only stops you from submitting a claim that would
certainly fail.

A third check, `check_submitted_reasons`, covers the optional `submitted_reasons` field the
reasoning grader reads: its shape, whether each citation resolves before the cutoff, the
published caps, the deny list and content-duplicate reasons (see "Checking your reasons" below).

A fourth, `check_claim_rules`, runs the scorer 5.2.2 **deterministic claim rules** on a whole
answer with the scorer's own code (see "Checking your claims (scorer 5.2.2)" below). It is the
only part of this rail that imports this repository's `qfbench2_track_analysis`; the other three
are pure standard library.

## What's here

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `citation_rail.py` | The checks. `load_corpus`, `filter_retrieved` (retrieval-time date rail), `check_answer` (submission-time rail → findings list; pass `task=` to check `"task"` citations), `check_submitted_reasons` (the reasoning field's shape, caps, deny list and duplicates), `check_claim_rules` (the scorer's deterministic 5.2.2 claim rules). |
| `demo.py` | Offline demo on `units/t4-EXAMPLE-eps-beat`: an agent "accidentally" cites a live-fetched post-cutoff snippet and emits one malformed span; the rail flags both, the clean claim passes. It also checks three submitted reasons: two clean, one whose mechanism pastes a URL carrying a deny-list token (`units/`), which the deny list flags (a plain URL is masked, not flagged). |
| `rails/` | Illustrative [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) wiring of the same checks as an output rail (`config.yml`, `flows.co`, `actions.py`). Requires `pip install nemoguardrails`; the demo does not. |
| `tests/` | Unit tests for the rail checks. |

## Run the demo

```bash
# from the repo root
python -m baselines.guardrails_example.demo
```

Expected output ends with `DEMO PASS — the rail caught exactly the planted problems.` The
planted post-cutoff document is synthetic text invented for the demo, marked as such in the
source.

## Using the rail in your own agent

```python
from baselines.guardrails_example.citation_rail import (
    load_corpus, filter_retrieved, check_answer,
)

corpus = load_corpus(unit_dir / "corpus")
usable, stale = filter_retrieved(list(corpus.values()), task["cutoff_date"])
# ... retrieve/reason over `usable` only ...
findings = check_answer(draft_answer, corpus, task["cutoff_date"], task=task)
if findings:
    ...  # drop or repair the flagged claims, then redraft
```

Two placements, use both: filter the retrieval pool up front so stale material never reaches
the reasoning step, and re-check the assembled answer just before writing it out.

A claim may cite the task table with `"doc_id": "task"`. Pass `task=` (the parsed `task.json`)
and the span is checked against the task-table text the scorer builds
(`qfbench2_track_analysis.corpus.task_table_text`): outside the table is `bad_span`, outside the
citing entity's own row is `task_row` (the scorer counts that claim false, as a wrong-entity
citation). Without `task=` such a citation is reported `task_unchecked`, never `unknown_doc`.

## Checking your claims (scorer 5.2.2)

```python
from baselines.guardrails_example.citation_rail import check_claim_rules

for finding in check_claim_rules(draft_answer, unit_dir):
    print(finding)  # e.g. [claim_unanchored] entity=AAPL claim#3: states a figure no cited span carries ...
```

Run it before your agent writes `answer.json`, and fix every finding: each one is a claim the
scorer counts as false. The Development board runs without the NLI contradiction check, but the
claim rules this checker applies are deterministic, so they apply on Development and in the
Final alike (from scorer 5.2.2 they include a citation over 8,000 characters and a content-free
claim).

Run it from the repository root (it imports `qfbench2_track_analysis`). It hydrates the unit the
way the scorer does and calls the scorer's own `evaluate_claims`, so its verdicts are the
scorer's; the organizer runs a parity test of the two over stored test answers. Each finding is one
reason a claim is false, and a false claim costs its share of the unit:

| code | what it means |
|---|---|
| `claim_wrong_entity` | a citation of a document the unit manifest does not label for the claim's entity (nor mark `shared`), or a `"task"` span outside the entity's own row |
| `claim_out_of_range` | offsets that are not a slice of the cited document |
| `claim_malformed` | empty, over 4,000 characters, or over 400 judge tokens; or (scorer 5.2.2) the claim carries a claim-level `citations` list, a removed shape: a claim cites one span of one document with its own `doc_id`, `span_start` and `span_end`, and the scorer does not read the list (the finding's message says which; `check_answer` reports it as `claim_citations`) |
| `claim_unanchored` | a figure no cited span carries (every figure, whole span; a word-for-word quote of a cited span passes; your scored values and the unit's own entity names and tickers are exempt) |
| `claim_over_cap` | a citation spans more than 8,000 characters; the claim is false whatever it states (cite the passage, not the document) |
| `claim_content_free` | no figure, nothing but function words and evidence/meta words, and either nothing but function words or a filler word about the evidence such as "evidence", "passage" or "cited" ("Pre-cutoff evidence selected for the submitted prediction."; "AAPL has no forecast." is contentful); the claim is false and is not put to the judge |
| `unit_refused` | the scorer refuses the whole unit before any claim rule (a missing, extra or repeated entity, a non-finite value, an unresolved, undated or post-cutoff citation); run `check_answer` to see which citation |
| `claim_tokens_unchecked` | needs tokenizer: the judge's tokenizer is not installed here, so the 400-token cap was not checked. Install `transformers` and the judge models (nothing is downloaded by this check), or pass `token_counter=` |

## Checking your reasons

```python
from baselines.guardrails_example.citation_rail import check_submitted_reasons

for finding in check_submitted_reasons(draft_answer, corpus, task["cutoff_date"]):
    print(finding)  # e.g. [cap_citation_chars] submitted_reasons reason#0: ...
```

An absent `submitted_reasons` field is clean: leaving reasons out never costs anything. A
`submitted_reasons` block that does not match the schema (an empty list, more than 3 reasons, or
a reason missing a required field) makes the whole answer invalid, like any schema error, and the
unit takes the worst value; that is the `reasons_shape` finding below, so clear it before you
submit. The finding codes:

| code | what it means | what the grader does |
|---|---|---|
| `reasons_shape` | not a list of 1 to 3 objects; a required field (`reason_id`, `premise`, `mechanism`, `answer_implication`) missing or not a string; `scope`, `scope.entities` or `citations` of the wrong shape | the whole answer fails the schema; the unit takes the worst value |
| `reason_citation` | a citation to an unknown document, an empty or out-of-range span, or a document dated after the cutoff | the judge never sees that passage |
| `cap_citation_chars` | a citation in this reason spans more than 8,000 characters | this reason is not judged (0); later reasons are still checked |
| `cap_answer_bytes` | your per-entity answer, as compact JSON, exceeds 3,000 UTF-8 bytes | the unit's reasoning is not judged (0) |
| `cap_reason_bytes` | this reason with the reasons judged before it (`reason_id`, `premise`, `mechanism`, `answer_implication`, URLs masked by `#`), as compact JSON, exceed 6,500 UTF-8 bytes | this reason is not judged (0); later reasons are still checked |
| `cap_evidence_bytes` | the resolved cited passages of this reason and of the reasons judged before it, with their doc id and offsets, as compact JSON (URIs masked), exceed 46,500 UTF-8 bytes | this reason is not judged (0); later reasons are still checked |
| `deny_list` | a deny-list phrase (on the text as written) in `mechanism` or `answer_implication`, or in a `premise` that is not a verbatim corpus quote of at least 3 words (URLs masked on both sides; a bare token such as `units/`, `canary` or a two-word quote is not one); URLs, disguised ones included (look-alike colons and slashes, invisible characters, `//host`, `www.`), are masked, not refused, but a URL containing a listed token is refused, and so is a `://` with no scheme letters before it; a disguised deny-listed phrase is refused too | the grader refuses that unit's reasoning (0); the analysis score is unaffected |
| `duplicate_reason` | the same `premise`, `mechanism` and `answer_implication` as an earlier reason (case, whitespace and invisible characters ignored) | that reason is not judged and covers no target reason; the others are judged |

A `"task"` citation in a reason is a `reason_citation`: the grader resolves reason citations
against the corpus only, so the judge never sees it. `reason_id` values are not checked: the
grader renumbers reasons by position and does not require unique ids.

The byte counts follow the grader (reasons renumbered r1..r3, URIs in cited text masked); the per-entity answer is counted with every answer field present, so it can only over-count.
`reasons_judged(answer, corpus, cutoff_date)` lists, in submitted order, which reasons the grader
will judge and which it will skip, and why: put your strongest reason first.
The contract itself, with a worked example on the exemplar unit, is in
[`SUBMISSION_CLI.md`](../../SUBMISSION_CLI.md#how-reasoning-is-scored).

## What this rail does, and does NOT do

It does: the date and shape rails on every claim citation (including `"task"` citations with
`task=`); every deterministic claim rule of scorer 5.2.2 (`check_claim_rules`: wrong entity, out
of range, malformed including the 400-judge-token cap when the tokenizer is installed, a citation
over 8,000 characters, every figure with the verbatim-quote pass and the name and ticker
exemption, a content-free claim); and
the reasoning field's shape, citations, caps, deny list and duplicate reasons.

It does NOT:

- run NLI. The contradiction check (the ensemble's three-way P(contradiction) above 0.9 makes
  a claim false) needs the models; `faithfulness/judge.py --answer … --unit …` runs it.
- It does not judge your reasons. A reason can pass every check and still score 0 against
  the unit's target reasons.
- It does not validate the full answer schema (use `templates/answer.example.json` and
  `qfbench2_common/schemas/analysis.schema.json` for that).
- It is not part of scoring or admissibility, and never will be — organizer-side gates are
  computed independently of anything you run locally.
