"""Prose-vs-artifact drift guards.

Prose that hand-duplicates an authoritative artifact (schema, card, code) drifts from it: the
artifact changes and the sentence restating it does not. These tests pin the four
highest-traffic fact classes to their artifacts so the next drift fails CI at authoring time
instead of surviving to a participant. Standard library only, so the whole file runs in the secret-free ``firewall``
CI job (which runs ``pytest baselines``).

Each guard says which past finding it would have caught, and carries the *exemplars* of that
finding class as executable controls: a guard that cannot demonstrate it catches its own class
is worse than no guard at all, because it gets cited as proof.

When one of these fails, the fix is almost never "edit the test": either the prose or the
artifact changed unilaterally — make them agree, or link the prose to the artifact instead of
restating it (the standing editorial rule in AGENTS.md).

Fail-closed rule: every patrolled document must be present. If a file named in
:data:`DOC_FILES` is deleted or renamed, these guards FAIL — they do not quietly patrol a
smaller corpus and report green.

# 5. No participant-facing document offers a bring-your-own model path        #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Would have caught the 2026-09-18 residue at authoring time. The ruling of 2026-09-18 withdrew
# bring-your-own entirely, and the withdrawal landed in README.md's category section, in
# SUBMISSION_CLI.md and in docs/ARTIFACT-POLICY.md's summary -- while three documents went on
# offering the adapter contract in the same tree, ARTIFACT-POLICY.md contradicting itself between
# its line 3 and its line 18. That document is the one a participant was pointed at when they
# asked this exact question. A reader who found the offer first read a rule that no longer existed.
#
# The rule is about OFFERS, not mentions, so the guard reads SENTENCES: a sentence that raises
# bring-your-own, BYO or a LoRA/adapter submission must also carry the withdrawal. An earlier
# version of this guard listed offer phrasings instead, and a review showed it green on
# "BYO model submissions are welcome." and on "Submit a LoRA adapter on the approved base." --
# a guard that patrols the four spellings the last incident happened to use.
#
# SUBMISSION_CLI.md keeps a `### Adapter-only BYO` section whose body says "Withdrawn", because
# outside links point at that anchor; that section carries a marker and stays green. A LINK whose
# target is the withdrawn anchor is an offender on its own -- a withdrawal cannot produce one.

#: Policy documents that are not in DOC_FILES (the other guards read numbers and paths these two
#: do not carry) but which state participant-facing rules. Same fail-closed rule.
POLICY_DOCS = [
    "docs/ARTIFACT-POLICY.md",
    "docs/TRAINING-POLICY.md",
]

#: Directories whose markdown is unit content, not participant-facing prose.
_BYO_SKIP_DIRS = {"units", "units_archived", "corpus", ".git", ".github"}

#: A link whose target is the withdrawn section. The heading itself is not a link, so the
#: withdrawal stub does not match; `[text](SUBMISSION_CLI.md#adapter-only-byo)` does.
_BYO_LINK_RE = re.compile(r"\]\([^)]*#adapter-only-byo\)", re.I)

_BYO_TERM_RE = re.compile(r"\bBYO\b|\bbyo-(?:small|large)\b|bring[-\s]your[-\s]own|\bLoRA\b|(?<![_a-z])adapters?\b", re.I)

#: The withdrawal, in the spellings the ruling and the toolkit actually use. Deliberately narrow:
#: an unrelated "invalid" or "held" elsewhere in the sentence must NOT clear a BYO offer, which is
#: how the first version let ``Use `byo-large`; an invalid descriptor is rejected`` through.
_BYO_WITHDRAWAL_RES = [
    re.compile(r"not\s+part\s+of\s+this\s+competition", re.I),
    re.compile(r"\bwithdrawn\b", re.I),

    re.compile(r"there\s+is\s+no\s+(?:LoRA|adapter)", re.I),
    re.compile(r"not\s+(?:authorized|permitted|available)", re.I),
]

#: Sentence boundary: a terminator, or a blank line / heading / table row / list bullet, because
#: prose here is hard-wrapped and a sentence routinely spans lines. A colon is NOT a boundary:
#: the withdrawal is regularly the lead-in and the detail follows it ("...are not part of this
#: competition (ruling of 2026-09-18): no LoRA adapter path, no in-image model weights path").
_BYO_SENTENCE_RE = re.compile(r"(?<=[.!?])\s+|\n\s*\n|\n(?=\s*(?:[#|*+-]|\d+\.))")
#: `>` is deliberately absent above: a hard-wrapped blockquote is one sentence per several
#: `> ` lines, and splitting on it separated a withdrawal lead-in from its own detail.
